			<p>Hi there! I'm a native New Yorker who grew up in Queens, went 
				to college at NYU, and later worked in hedge funds and consumer finance in the city.
			</p>
			<p>	
				Over the past couple of years, I've become increasingly interested in technology, 
				particularly software development. I have always had an interest in entrepreneurship 
				as well, so it just seemed to make a lot of sense to learn how I could use technology
				to support my future dream business. 
			</p>
			<p> 
				I am still trying to figure out what exact type of business I want to do, 
				but I'm interested in platforms that connect people to other people and have found myself
				gravitating towards beauty/fashion, event planning, and education.
			<p>		
				As for my hobbies, I will admit that I am a self-improvement junkie. I love reading 
				books about it, ranging from topics of entrepreneurship, personal finance, fitness, etc. 
				I also love setting goals for myself. It's a small obsession.
